# Don't Buy This Token

## Project Overview

"Don't Buy This Token" is a learning project aimed at creating and deploying a custom Solana token. The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience with blockchain development, Docker, Rust, and Solana CLI while creating a functional token that can be deployed on the Solana mainnet.

## Goals
- **Create a token on Solana's devnet**: Use Solana's test environment to design and deploy a token.
- **Deploy the token to the mainnet**: Spend approximately $20 to publish the token on the Solana mainnet.
- **Document the process**: Provide clear instructions and insights for others interested in creating tokens.
- **Develop a portfolio project**: Showcase skills in blockchain development and modern technologies.

## Key Features
- **Token Creation**: Generate a token on Solana devnet and mainnet.
- **Metadata Integration**: Add metadata such as token name, symbol, and icon.
- **Decentralized Hosting**: Utilize decentralized storage for token assets (e.g., Pinata/IPFS).
- **Learning-Focused**: Prioritize understanding blockchain technology and tools.

## Technologies Used
- **Solana Blockchain**: The platform for creating and managing the token.
- **Docker**: Containerize the development environment for portability.
- **Rust**: Utilize Rust for working with Solana CLI.
- **Pinata/IPFS**: Host token metadata and assets.

## Steps to Complete
1. **Set Up Environment**
   - Install Docker.
   - Configure a container with Solana CLI and Rust.
2. **Token Creation on Devnet**
   - Generate accounts for mint authority and wallet.
   - Create and configure a token on the devnet.
   - Upload metadata to decentralized storage.
3. **Deploy Token to Mainnet**
   - Acquire SOL for mainnet deployment.
   - Repeat the token creation process on the mainnet.
4. **Documentation and Publication**
   - Create a GitHub repository with detailed instructions.
   - Share insights and lessons learned.

## Why "Don't Buy This Token"?
The name highlights the experimental nature of the project and serves as a playful reminder of the many token projects that fail to deliver. This project aims to be a learning experience rather than a speculative venture.

## Token Details
- **Name**: Don't Buy This Token
- **Symbol**: DBTt

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dontbuythistoken.git
   cd dontbuythistoken
   ```
2. Follow the step-by-step guide provided in the repository.

## Future Plans
- Add examples of using the token in small decentralized applications.
- Explore integration with other blockchain ecosystems.
